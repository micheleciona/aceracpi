==1. What is acer_acpi?==

Jump to the [http://code.google.com/p/aceracpi/ main page] to find out.

==2. What hardware is supported or unsupported?==

See http://code.google.com/p/aceracpi/wiki/SupportedHardware (although the list is incomplete)

==3. It doesn't work on supported hardware! I get "Unable to register driver, aborting!"==

Please upgrade to the latest version of acer_acpi. If that still doesn't work, please file a bug.

==4. "Sorry, not yet implemented" or "Sorry, reading status not yet implemented"==

Please upgrade to the latest version of acer_acpi

==5. dmesg tells me "No or unsupported WMI interface, unable to load"==

Your laptop does not have the WMI-ACPI interface we use to control the hardware. There may be an alternative interface we don't know about - in order to find it, we'll need to do some disassembly of your ACPI DSDT.

==6. "acer_acpi: Unknown symbol led_classdev_unregister"==

You need to enable the LED subsystem in your kernel configuration.

==7. "acer_acpi: Unknown symbol backlight_device_register "==

You need to enable the backlight subsystem in your kernel configuration.

==8. When is the next version of acer_acpi coming out?==

acer_acpi is now deprecated. So unless there's a major bug fix required, there won't be one.


And finally, not a frequently-asked-question ...

==9. Can I maintain a package for $LINUX_DISTRO?==

Please don't. acer-wmi is now available in mainline kernels, it would be better to just move to a newer kernel.

==10. When will acer_acpi go mainline?==

acer-wmi, the upstream port of acer_acpi, was merged into 2.6.25.

==11. What will happen to acer_acpi now?==

acer_acpi will now go into bug-fixing only mode, and be maintained exclusively for older kernels.

All development work will switch to the in-kernel acer-wmi instead.
