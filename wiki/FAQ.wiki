==1. What is acer_acpi?==

Jump to the [http://code.google.com/p/aceracpi/ main page] to find out.

==2. What hardware is supported or unsupported?==

See http://code.google.com/p/aceracpi/wiki/SupportedHardware (although the list is incomplete)

==3. It doesn't work on supported hardware! I get "Unable to register driver, aborting!"==

Please upgrade to the latest version of acer_acpi. If that still doesn't work, please file a bug.

==4. "Sorry, not yet implemented" or "Sorry, reading status not yet implemented"==

Please upgrade to the latest version of acer_acpi

==5. dmesg tells me "No or unsupported WMI interface, unable to load"==

Your laptop does not have the WMI-ACPI interface we use to control the hardware. There may be an alternative interface we don't know about - in order to find it, you'll need to do some disassembly of your ACPI DSDT.

==6. dmesg tells me "acer_acpi: Unknown symbol led_classdev_unregister"==

You need to enable the LED subsystem in your kernel configuration.

==7. When is the next version of aceracpi coming out?==

When It's Ready(TM).


And finally, not a frequently-asked-question ...

==8. Can I maintain a package for $LINUX_DISTRO?==

Feel free! That's what the GPL is for :-) But I'd appreciate an email, so I know in advance where to direct questions ;-)

==10. When will acer_acpi go mainline?==

Short answer: A while longer yet

Long answer:

acer_acpi relies on the WMI-ACPI interface device (defined by the laptops ACPI implementation) - what we currently do is register this device for ourselves, and just call the methods inside it that we know about.

The problem with this approach is that WMI ACPI is used on more than just acer_acpi compatible laptops. The correct solution is to create a new driver, wmi.c, that would parse the WMI device, and provide the methods to us in a way that makes them available for all future WMI based drivers (and a method that is somewhat "saner" than the current one - although with an MS based 'specification', this is a somewhat relative term).

(wmi.c is in progress by me (Carlos) - I have submitted my initial work the ACPI mailing list, and it is currently in the review & modification process before acceptance).

acer_acpi would then be rebased against this wmi driver (rather than the current mess of trying to maintain the ACPI code to talk to the two different WMI interfaces ourselves - this is currently being done in acer_acpi 0.10).
