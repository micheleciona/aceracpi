== Introduction ==

To summarise: the driver only supports those laptops that present a WMI interface that can be manipulated via ACPI. So, any laptop that doesn't provide this interface, or any of the older Dritek type laptops are not supported (for the latter, use acerhk). Laptops using the newer WMI interface are not yet supported.

acer_acpi is not limited to just Acer laptops - we know at least one Fujitsu Siemens laptop uses this interface as well.

Unfortunately, it is not possible to tell by the hardware alone what models require acer_acpi - different models use different chipsets (ATi and nVidia have both been seen). The chances are, if you need to install LaunchManager (or similar) on Windows just to turn on your wireless, bluetooth, etc, then you probably need this driver.

If you discover your hardware is supported by acer_acpi and it is not listed here, please send a dump of /proc/acpi/dsdt to me (cathectic(@)gmail.com), also listing the make and model of your laptop.

If your hardware is not listed on either supported or unsupported, and acer_acpi does not load, please send me the dump of /proc/acpi/dsdt and the make and model anyway, as that way we can decide if acer_acpi just needs tweaking to work on your hardware, or so we can definitely rule out your hardware as compatible.

If your hardware is listed as _not_ having a dump available, please send one - we are looking into any additional functionality that acer_acpi can expose (which, at the moment, seems to be none).

All of our available DSDT dumps (translated to readable ASL) can be found in the [http://aceracpi.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/dsdt/ Subversion repository]

Legend:

  * [u] = Unconfirmed (Taken from the internet, please confirm if you have this model)
  * [c] = Confirmed (We have been told that this works, or confirmed that it doesn't)
  * [d] = DSDT available
  * [dw] = DSDT wanted (Please submit yours to us)
  * [n] = No WMI ACPI interface, will not support
  * [r] = New WMI ACPI interface, requires reverse engineering (please contact us to help with this if you can)

== Unsupported ==

This list is _very_ incomplete. The models listed here are the ones known to absolutely _not_ work with this driver - if you have one of these: it is not, cannot and will not (unless stated otherwise) be supported by acer_acpi. (Some of these might be useable with acerhk, or the wireless/ bluetooth switches may be hardware driven instead and not require any software).
