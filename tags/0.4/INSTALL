Installation
************

1. You need the kernel sources (or kernel headers for your kernel)
installed to compile the driver.

2. Your kernel needs loadable module support with version information for
modules enabled. Usage of procfs is highly recommended.
If you want the driver to generate regular keyboard events using
kernel version 2.4 you need the input system of the kernel enabled
(Input core support AND keyboard support). In kernel version 2.6 all
needed functionality should be available by default.

### I HAVE NO IDEA IF THIS WILL WORK WITH A 2.4 SERIES KERNEL ###

In most cases you can skip the next step, the Makefile tries do determine
the correct directory on its own. Change KERNELSRC only if the autodetection
does not work for you. Otherwise proceed directly with step 4.

3. Before you compile the driver, change KERNELSRC in the makefile to your
path to the kernel build environment. If you are using a self compiled kernel,
point it to the root of your sources. If you are using a packaged kernel of
your distribution, install the package with kernel headers
(Debian:kernel-headers) and point KERNELSRC to where the headers and config
files are located. If you are using Debian, this
would be "/lib/modules/<kernelversion>/build".

4. Do:
	make
to compile the driver. If you run into problems because of the makefile not
recognizing your kernel version correctly, try this:
	make acer_acpi.o	- kernel version 2.4
	make acer_acpi.ko	- kernel version 2.6

5. Do:
	make install
to install the kernel module.  If that step fails, try:

Copy the created file "acer_acpi.o" ("acer_acpi.ko" with version 2.6) to your
kernel modules path. In Debian this could be
"/lib/modules/<kernelversion>/kernel/drivers/char/".
Update module dependencies: depmod -a

6. Try loading the module with:
	insmod/modprobe acer_acpi

If you don't see any error messages, check the README for usage information.
