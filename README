This is acer_acpi version 0.9.1

### THIS IS VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS.  NO WARRANTY GIVEN.  IF YOU
### BREAK YOUR LAPTOP USING THIS DRIVER, YOU GET TO KEEP THE PIECES AND
### I WILL ACCEPT ABSOLUTELY NO RESPONSIBILITY.

acer_acpi is a driver to allow you to control various aspects of your Acer
laptop hardware using the proc filesystem.  It was originally developed by Mark
Smith, in order to activate the wireless LAN card under a 64-bit version of
Linux, as acerhk[1] (the previous fine solution to the problem) relied on making
BIOS calls which are not allowed from a 64-bit OS.

Please read the INSTALL file for installation instructions.

acer_acpi is now being maintained by Carlos Corbacho <cathectic@gmail.com>

Usage
*****

As root, modprobe acer_acpi

(To enable debugging, add debug=X, where X is between 0 and 2).

acer_acpi creates entries under /proc/acpi/acer (deprecated),
/sys/devices/platform/acer_acpi, /sys/class/backlight (2.6.20 and above only)
and /sys/class/led, which enables you to control some of the following (varies
between models):

* the wireless LAN card
* inbuilt Bluetooth adapter
* mail LED of your laptop
* brightness of the LCD panel

The syntax for each is the same:

PLEASE NOTE: "enabled: X" support has now been removed

To read the status of a device (0=off, 1=on):
cat /proc/acpi/acer/{device}
or
cat /sys/devices/platform/acer_acpi/{device}

To enable a feature:
echo 1 > /proc/acpi/acer/{feature}
or
echo 1 > /sys/devices/platform/acer_acpi/{device}

To disable a feature:
echo 0 > /proc/acpi/acer/{feature}
echo 0 > /sys/devices/platform/acer_acpi/{device}

(brightness and mail LED are not visible in /sys/devices/platform - these are
properly registered with the relevant kernel subsystem).

To enable a feature on loading the module:
modprobe acer_acpi {feature}=1

To disable a feature on loading the module (default):
modprobe acer_acpi {feature}=0

Where {feature} is either wireless, bluetooth, 3G, or mailled. (You can have 
multiple {feature}'s specified on the modprobe line).

For laptops with a "brightness" option, you can write a value between 0 to 15 
(or 0x0 to 0xF).

Notes
*****

The behaviour of the wireless LED will depend on your hardware and driver
combination.

e.g. With the BCM4318 on the 5020 series:

ndiswrapper: Light blinks on when transmitting
bcm43xx/b43: Solid light, blinks off when transmitting

Also, acer_acpi does not yet have any means of deciding whether to
enable or disable entries in proc or sysfs - this means that for
hardware that isn't there, you can still read/ write the corresponding file.

So: Just because it _says_ "bluetooth" in /proc/acpi/acer, doesn't mean 
you now actually have a Bluetooth device.

If you have problems with the driver, please file a bug on the website and
include the following information:
1. name of your laptop (e.g. Acer Aspire 5021)
2. contents of your ACPI DSDT (cat /proc/acpi/dsdt).  I can disassemble
   it if necessary, so I'll accept the binaries.

Please check http://code.google.com/p/aceracpi/wiki/SupportedHardware first to
see if your hardware is supported or unsupported.
