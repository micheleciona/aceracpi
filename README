This is acer-laptop version 0.1

### THIS IS VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS.  NO WARRANTY GIVEN.  IF YOU
### BREAK YOUR LAPTOP USING THIS DRIVER, YOU GET TO KEEP THE PIECES AND
### I WILL ACCEPT ABSOLUTELY NO RESPONSIBILITY.

acer-laptop was derived from the original acer_acpi - acer_acpi has been 
modified to use sysfs and move various devices to specific subsystems. Because
of the work involved, it has been decided to fork this work as acer-laptop (in
line with other in-kernel drivers) and work on submitting this upstream 
(acer_acpi will be kept around for reference).

acer_acpi was a driver to allow you to control various aspects of your Acer
laptop hardware using the proc filesystem.  It was originally developed in
order to activate the wireless LAN card under a 64-bit version of Linux,
as acerhk[1] (the previous fine solution to the problem) relied on making BIOS
calls which are not allowed from a 64-bit OS.

Please read the INSTALL file for installation instructions.

Usage
*****

As root, modprobe acer-laptop

(To enable debugging, add debug=X, where X is between 0 and 2).

acer-laptop creates entries under /sys/devices/platform/acer-laptop, which 
enables you to control some of the following (varies between models):

* the wireless LAN card
* inbuilt Bluetooth adapter

The syntax for each is the same:

To enable the wireless, bluetooth or threeg features:
echo 1 > /proc/acpi/acer/{feature}

To disable the wireless, bluetooth or threeg features:
echo 0 > /proc/acpi/acer/{feature}

The mail LED is integrated into the kernels LED subsystem, so can be found in:

/sys/class/leds

and is acer:mail

The brightness of the LCD panel is integrated into the backlight subsystem, can
can be found in:

/sys/class/backlight/acer-laptop

To enable a feature on loading the module:
modprobe acer_acpi {feature}=1

To disable a feature on loading the module (default):
modprobe acer_acpi {feature}=0

Where {feature} is either wireless, bluetooth, 3G, or mailled. (You can have 
multiple {feature}'s specified on the modprobe line).

For WMID laptops with a "brightness" option, you can write a value between 0 to
15 (or 0x0 to 0xF).

To enable support for 3G devices on WMID, you will need to edit acer_acpi.c and 
replace:

#undef EXPERIMENTAL_INTERFACES

with

#define EXPERIMENTAL_INTERFACES

(If you have the hardware to test this with, please report back the results)

Notes
*****

The behaviour of the wireless LED will depend on your hardware and driver
combination.

e.g. With the BCM4318 on the 5020 series:

ndiswrapper: Light blinks on when transmitting
bcm43xx/ 
bcm43xx_mac80211: Solid light, blinks off when transmitting

Also, acer_acpi does not yet have any means of deciding whether to
enable or disable entries in /proc/acpi/acer - this means that for
hardware that isn't there, you can still read/ write the corresponding proc
file.

So: Just because it _says_ Bluetooth in /proc/acpi/acer, doesn't mean you now 
actually have a Bluetooth device.

Also: We do not store the status of the device when you hibernate. On AMW0,
this will cause incorrect values to be returned from sysfs (this is a known
issue and is being worked on).

If you have problems with the driver, please file a bug on the website and
include the following information:
1. name of your laptop (e.g. Acer Aspire 5021)
2. contents of your ACPI DSDT (this will require acpidump).  I can disassemble
   it if necessary, so I'll accept the binaries.

Please check http://code.google.com/p/aceracpi/wiki/SupportedHardware first to
see if your hardware is supported or unsupported.
