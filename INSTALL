Installation
************

1. You need the kernel sources (or kernel headers for your kernel)
installed to compile the driver.

2. Your kernel needs loadable module support with version information for
modules enabled. Usage of procfs is highly recommended.

2.4 series kernels are not supported - you must use a 2.6 series kernel.

In most cases you can skip the next step, the Makefile tries do determine
the correct directory on its own. Change KERNELSRC _only_ if the 
autodetection does not work for you. Otherwise proceed directly with step 4.

3. Before you compile the driver, change KERNELSRC in the makefile to your
path to the kernel build environment. If you are using a self compiled kernel,
point it to the root of your sources. If you are using a packaged kernel of
your distribution, install the package with kernel headers
(Debian:kernel-headers) and point KERNELSRC to where the headers and config
files are located. If you are using Debian, this
would be "/lib/modules/<kernelversion>/build".

4. Do:
	make

5. Do:
	make install
to install the kernel module. (You can use DESTDIR for repackaging).

If that step fails, try:

Copy the created file "acer_acpi.ko" to your kernel modules path. For most
distributions, this is usually:
"/lib/modules/<kernelversion>/kernel/drivers/char/".
Update module dependencies: depmod -a

6. Try loading the module with:
	insmod/modprobe acer_acpi

If you don't see any error messages, check the README for usage information.
