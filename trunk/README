This is acer_acpi version 0.5

### THIS IS VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS.  NO WARRANTY GIVEN.  IF YOU
### BREAK YOUR LAPTOP USING THIS DRIVER, YOU GET TO KEEP THE PIECES AND
### I WILL ACCEPT ABSOLUTELY NO RESPONSIBILITY.

acer_acpi is a driver to allow you to control various aspects of your Acer
laptop hardware using the proc filesystem.  It was originally developed in
order to activate the wireless LAN card under a 64-bit version of Linux,
as acerhk[1] (the previous fine solution to the problem) relied on making BIOS
calls which are not allowed from a 64-bit OS.

Please read the INSTALL file for installation instructions.

PLEASE NOTE: I (Mark Smith) AM NO LONGER ACTIVELY DEVELOPING ACER_ACPI.
(many would note that I never actively developed it! :-)

acer_acpi is now being maintained by Carlos Corbacho <cathectic@gmail.com>

Usage
*****

As root, modprobe acer_acpi

acer_acpi creates entries under /proc/acpi/acer, which enable you to control
the wireless LAN card, inbuilt Bluetooth adapter, and mail LED of your laptop.
The syntax for each is the same:

To enable a feature:
echo "enabled : 1" > /proc/acpi/acer/{feature}

To disable a feature:
echo "enabled : 0" > /proc/acpi/acer/{feature}

To enable a feature on loading the module:
modprobe acer_acpi {feature}=1

To disable a feature on loading the module (default):
modprobe acer_acpi {feature}=0

Where {feature} is either wireless, bluetooth, or mailled. (You can have 
multiple {feature}'s specified on the modprobe line).

Notes
*****

The behaviour of the wireless LED will depend on your hardware and driver
combination.

e.g. With the BCM4318 on the 5020 series:

ndiswrapper: Light blinks on when transmitting
bcm43xx/ 
bcm43xx_mac80211: Solid light, blinks off when transmitting

Also, acer_acpi does not yet have any means of deciding whether to
enable or disable entries in /proc/acpi/acer - this means that for
hardware that isn't there, you can call "enabled"/ "disabled", it will
update the value in /proc/acpi/acer/{feature}[1] and won't inform you.

So: Just because it _says_ Bluetooth in /proc/acpi/acer, doesn't mean 
you now actually have a Bluetooth device.

[1] We have to keep track ourselves of whether the driver is enabled or
    disabled.

If you have problems with the driver, please file a bug on the website and
include the following information:
1. name of your laptop (e.g. Acer Aspire 5021)
2. contents of your ACPI DSDT (this will require acpidump).  I can disassemble
   it if necessary, so I'll accept the binaries.

Aspire 5000
series users: There is no support for your machines, and very likely
              never will be, as we cannot find any ACPI method to
              control the wireless, etc.
