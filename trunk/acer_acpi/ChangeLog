2007-09-03	Version 0.8.2

* Really fix backlight code on older kernels

* Fix write errors with /proc/acpi/acer/brightness

* Fix problem with driver registration on WMID

2007-09-02	Version 0.8.1

* Fix backlight code on older (pre 2.6.21) kernels

2007-09-01	Version 0.8

* Register backlight with backlight subsystem

* Register mail LED with LED subsystem

* Restored 3G support - please note that on WMID laptops, if you try to write
  to a device that you don't have, you _will_ get an ACPI error in dmesg (on
  AMW0 this just fails silently).

* Added new sysfs platform driver to /sys/devices/platform/acer_acpi

* Added EC support for Aspire 3020, 3040, 5040, 5650 and 9300

* Code clean up - switched C99 types to kernel types, removed typedefs

2007-08-02	Version 0.7

* Removed "enabled: X" support

* Added initial support for accessing extra devices/ information through the
  Embedded Controller (limited to just the Aspire 5020 and TravelMate 2490 -
  thanks to Petr Tomasek for the TravelMate 2490 support). To test this on
  another laptop, use "force_series=5020" or "force_series=2490" and report
  back the results. On the 5020 (AMW0), brightness and accurate reading of 
  wireless and mail LED are supported. On the 2490 (WMID), mail LED is now
  supported, as well as reading touchpad status. Also, it is possible to force
  the fan on with both laptops by setting the temperature through ACPI.

* Added suspend/ resume support (settings will be correctly stored on return
  from suspend-to-RAM and suspend-to-disk).

* Removed typdefs

2007-07-17      Version 0.6.3

* Fix Bash 3.2 bug in Makefile (really fixes *buntu build bug)

2007-07-15      Version 0.6.2

* Fix packaging bug from 0.6.1 (directory name accidentally
  dropped acer_acpi-)

2007-07-13	Version 0.6.1

* Remove 2.4 kernel check, as it breaks *buntu systems
  (acer_acpi is still 2.6 only)

2007-07-06	Version 0.6

* Ran code through lindent (Kernel coding style)

* Deprecated "enabled : X" - "X" will now just work

* Patched Makefile to stop complaining on kernels <= 2.6.17
  (thanks to Subbu)

* Added support for new "WMID" interface (thanks to Jim Ramsay)

* Rewrote backend code for all interfaces and /proc (thanks to
  Jim Ramsay)

2007-05-05	Version 0.5

* Added new maintainer (Carlos Corbacho)

* cat /proc/acpi/acer/{feature} now works

* All devices are now turned off by default

* Fixed Makefile to build with kernels < 2.6.17 (Bug #2)

* Dropped support for 2.4 kernels

2007-03-31	Version 0.4

* Now builds on current kernels! (thanks to Carlos Corbacho)

* acer_acpi has a new home: http://code.google.com/p/aceracpi
