### THIS IS VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS.  NO WARRANTY GIVEN.  IF YOU
### BREAK YOUR LAPTOP USING THIS DRIVER, YOU GET TO KEEP THE PIECES AND
### WE WILL ACCEPT ABSOLUTELY NO RESPONSIBILITY.

acer_acpi is a driver to allow you to control various aspects of your Acer
laptop hardware using the Linux kernel, on Acer laptops that have the ACPI
devices AMW0 or WMID (both are attached to HID device PNP0C14).

Background
**********

acer_acpi was originally developed in order to activate the wireless LAN card
under a 64-bit version of Linux, as acerhk[1] (the previous fine solution to the
problem) relied on making 32-bit BIOS calls which are not allowed from a 64-bit
OS.

However, acer_acpi will work on both x86 and x86-64.

Platform specific
*****************

Loading acer_acpi will create the following directory:

/sys/devices/platform/acer_acpi/

In this directory are the following files, which you can read/write to with
the standard *NIX tools (cat, echo, etc...).

wireless	Enable/ disable the wireless device
bluetooth	Enable/ disable the bluetooth device
threeg		Enable/ disable the 3G device (WMID only)

e.g. 

To enable wireless:
	# echo 1 > /sys/devices/platform/acer_acpi/wireless
To disable wireless:
	# echo 0 > /sys/devices/platform/acer_acpi/wireless
To read the wireless status:
	# cat /sys/devices/platform/acer_acpi/wireless

Backlight
*********

If your backlight is supported (WMID only), this directory will exist:

/sys/class/backlight/acer_acpi/

Acer backlights support brightness values of 0 to 15

Mail LED
********

If your mail LED is supported (AMW0 only), this directory will exist:

/sys/class/leds/acer_acpi:mail

Multimedia Keys
***************

Some newer Acer laptops inexplicably require an old keyboard quirk to make the
multimedia keys emit scancodes.

This quirk is automatically applied on those laptops that we know require it.
If the multimedia keys on your laptop do not work, please contact us so we can
add your laptop to this list.

Bugs/ Limitations
*****************

* Acer has provided _no_ information or documentation on their hardware - this
driver is the result of the hard work of many people deciphering Acer's
hardware.

* The behaviour of the wireless LED will depend on your hardware and driver
combination.

e.g. With the BCM4318 on the 5020 series:

ndiswrapper: Light blinks on when transmitting
bcm43xx: Solid light, blinks off when transmitting

* AMW0 does not provide any methods to retrieve the current status of a device.
We therefore store the last value we wrote to the device and return this. On
startup for AMW0, we default to turning all the devices off so we have a sane
default. This means that the status value can be wrong on X86_32 if you use
wistron_btns to manipulate the same hardware.

* acer_acpi does not yet have any means of deciding whether to enable or disable
entries in sysfs - this means that for hardware that isn't there, you can still
read/ write the corresponding sysfs file.

(So: Just because there is a bluetooth file, doesn't mean you now actually have
a Bluetooth device.)

* AMW0 and WMID expose different capabilities (e.g. the mail LED works on AMW0,
but not WMID).

* We don't gurantee acer_acpi will work on your laptop. We keep a list of known
supported (and some known unsupported hardware) here:
http://code.google.com/p/aceracpi/wiki/SupportedHardware

If your hardware is not on that list, please send in your DSDT (/proc/acpi/dsdt)
