	  This driver drives the PNP0C14 device found on many 2005 and newer
	  Acer laptops (and known to work on some Fujitsu Siemens laptops). It
	  adds support for wireless, bluetooth, backlight and mail LED control.

	  For more information, see <file:Documentation/acer_acpi.txt>
	  and read <http://code.google.com/p/aceracpi/wiki/SupportedHardware>
	  for a list of hardware known to work with the driver.

	  If you are not sure, say N here.
